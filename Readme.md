# Secure File Sharing Platform

A secure file sharing platform built with Django, React, and Keycloak, featuring end-to-end encryption and advanced access controls.

## Development Acknowledgment

This project was developed with approximately 95% of the codebase being generated through AI assistance, primarily using Anthropic's Claude. This approach enabled rapid development while maintaining code quality and security standards. The AI assistance was particularly valuable in:

- Architecture design
- Code generation
- Security implementation
- Documentation
- Bug fixing and optimization

Human oversight and validation were maintained throughout the development process to ensure code quality.

## Features

- üîí End-to-end file encryption
- üîë Role-based authentication with Keycloak
- üë• User role management (Admin/User)
- üîó Secure file sharing with expiry
- üìä File access analytics
- üõ°Ô∏è Advanced access controls

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Windows/Linux/MacOS
- Modern web browser
- Git

## Project Structure

```tree
secure-files/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/          # Django backend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/         # React frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init-keycloak.sh  # Keycloak initialization script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyasY2k/secure-files
   cd secure-files
   ```
2. Start the services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This command will:

   - Build and start all necessary containers
   - Initialize Keycloak with default realms and users
   - Set up the database
   - Start the frontend and backend services
3. Access the services:

   - Frontend UI: http://localhost:3003
   - Keycloak Admin Console: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3002

## Default Users

The system comes with two pre-configured users:

### Admin User

- Username: admin
- Password: Admin@123456
- Role: admin

### Regular User

- Username: user
- Password: User@123456
- Role: user

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Change these credentials in production!

## Keycloak Configuration

- Admin Username: `admin`
- Admin Password: 'CDEWSXZAQ!#'
- Admin Console: http://localhost:3001

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Docker Image Pull Issues
   Some base images might fail to pull automatically. If you encounter pull errors, try manually pulling these images first:
   ```bash
   docker pull python:3.9-slim
   docker pull node:18-slim
   docker pull postgres:13
   docker pull quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:24.0.2
   ```
   Then run `docker-compose up --build` again.

2. Keycloak Connection Issues
   - Ensure all services are up: `docker-compose ps`
   - Check Keycloak logs: `docker-compose logs keycloak`
   - Wait for Keycloak initialization to complete

3. File Upload Issues
   - Check storage permissions
   - Verify file size limits
   - Check backend logs: `docker-compose logs backend`

4. Authorization Issues
   - Verify user roles in Keycloak admin console
   - Check token configuration
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
